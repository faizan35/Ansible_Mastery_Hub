# 2.2 Variables and Facts in Ansible

**Variables:**

In Ansible, variables allow you to parameterize playbooks and make them more flexible and dynamic. Variables can be defined at different levels, including playbooks, inventory files, or external variable files.

```yaml

```

In this example:

- The variable `http_port` is defined with a value of `80`.
- It is then used within the playbook to specify the desired HTTP port.

**Facts:**

Facts in Ansible are pieces of information about remote systems that are automatically collected during playbook execution. They are accessible as variables and provide insights into the managed nodes.

```yaml

```

In this example:

- The `gather_facts: yes` option is used to collect facts about the remote systems.
- The playbook then displays the distribution information using the `debug` module.
