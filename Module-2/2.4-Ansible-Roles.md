# 2.3 Ansible Roles

- Roles are a way to organize and structure Ansible playbooks in a modular fashion.

## 2.3.1 Organizing Playbook Logic

Ansible roles provide a way to organize and structure playbooks, making them modular and reusable. A role encapsulates related tasks, variables, and files into a directory structure. This modular approach simplifies playbook management, especially for larger projects.

### **Role Structure:**

A typical role directory structure looks like this:

```css
roles/
  web_server/
    tasks/
      main.yml
    vars/
      main.yml
    files/
      index.html
    meta/
      main.yml
```

- **tasks/main.yml:** Contains the main tasks of the role.
- **vars/main.yml:** Defines variables specific to the role.
- **files/:** Directory for static files.
- **meta/main.yml:** Contains metadata about the role.

### **Using Roles in Playbooks:**

To use a role in a playbook, the `roles` directive is added:

```yaml
---
- name: Use Roles
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes

  roles:
    - web_server
```

This structure enhances readability, reusability, and maintainability of Ansible playbooks.

## 2.3.2 Ansible Galaxy: Using and Creating Roles

Ansible Galaxy is a platform for finding, sharing, and creating Ansible roles.

- To use a role from Galaxy:

  ```bash
  ansible-galaxy install username.role_name
  ```

- To create a new role:

  ```bash
  ansible-galaxy init role_name
  ```

Using roles from Ansible Galaxy can save time and provide tested, community-contributed solutions.

## 2.3.3 Templating with Jinja2 in Ansible

**Jinja2** is the templating engine used in Ansible. It allows dynamic content generation within templates.

```yaml
---
- name: Use Jinja2 Template
  hosts: web_servers
  vars:
    app_name: MyWebApp

  tasks:
    - name: Create configuration file
      template:
        src: templates/app.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ app_name }}
```

In `templates/app.conf.j2`:

```jinja2
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name {{ app_name }};
    ...
}
```

Jinja2 expressions enclosed in double curly braces (`{{ ... }}`) are replaced with variable values during template rendering.
