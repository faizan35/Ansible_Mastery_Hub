# 6.2 Using Ansible with Containers:

## 6.2.1 Using Ansible with Docker:

Ansible can be a powerful tool for managing Docker containers, providing automation capabilities for tasks such as image building, container deployment, and orchestration.

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
---
- name: Manage Docker Containers
  hosts: docker_servers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Docker is installed
      apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present

    - name: Pull Docker Image
      docker_image:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Run Docker Container
      docker_container:
        name: my_nginx
        image: nginx
        state: started
        ports:
          - "80:80"
```

In this example playbook:

- Ensure that Docker is installed on the target hosts.
- Pull the Nginx Docker image.
- Run a Docker container named "my_nginx" with the Nginx image, exposing port 80.

## 6.2.2 Using Ansible with Kubernetes:

Ansible provides modules for managing Kubernetes resources, enabling automation of tasks related to Kubernetes deployments.

**Example Playbook:**

```yaml
---
- name: Manage Kubernetes Deployments
  hosts: k8s_servers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Apply Kubernetes Deployment
      k8s:
        definition: /path/to/deployment.yaml
        state: present
```

In this example playbook:

- Apply a Kubernetes Deployment by specifying the path to the deployment YAML file.
